# Planty

Planty is an arduino-based, small-scale device that is built to water the plant based upon it's soil moisture level. It's code is written to be scalable, short and informant. The code includes the check for sensor placement, water-level, pre-watering and completion of the task (watering the plant). Written in C++, the code manages to keep it's file-size at 27% of the dynamic memory ATmega328 A000005 in Arduino Nano has to offer. Do read the code!
